# Purpose: 
#    This yaml file declares the different variables. It uses
#    a Python dictionary syntax
#

# I have already defined these two variables, which are used
# in the master playbook.
# @@ make sure to add the local user's username @@
local_user: Honore

cloud_user: cc  # user on chameleon VMs is cc
cloud_name: "chameleon"


# SSH keypair to use for VM creation (must be pre-configured in Chameleon)
ssh_key_name: "Emman"

# Image name to use for creating VMs
image_name: "CC-Ubuntu22.04"

# VM flavor to be used (adjust based on assignment)
vm_flavor: m1.medium

# Prefix for VM names to be created
vm_name_prefix: "team20_vm"

# Number of VMs to create
num_vms: 4

# Network details for VMs
network_name: "CH-822922-net"

# Security group for VMs
security_groups:
  - default

# @@ You have to add additional variables here that you need
#    in the different children playbooks. This could be things
#    like VM properties such as VM name prefix, the flavor like
#    m1.medium, project number and all the things you need to
#    create the VM.
